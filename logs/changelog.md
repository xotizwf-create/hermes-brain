# Changelog

Append-only, newest on top. Every approved change to the brain gets one line.

## 2026-05-29
- Fixed mojibake in `projects/albery/server-context.md`: 771 legacy lines were double-encoded
  (UTF-8 bytes read as CP1251 then re-encoded). Repaired in place via per-line round-trip
  (`cp1251.GetBytes` → `utf8.GetString`), kept already-clean lines, normalized CRLF→LF. 0 residual
  U+FFFD. Earlier "UTF-8 verified clean" claim was wrong (see mistakes.md).
- `scripts/validate.py`: also skip `CLAUDE.md` (landing/instruction file, no frontmatter needed).
- Created isolated `hermes-brain` repo. Built areas: profile, engineering (migrated + new
  coding-standards/code-review), projects (template, manifest schema, registry generator,
  validator), connectors (gmail/calendar/drive/bitrix/zoom), personal, skills, logs.
- Migrated albery as first reference project.
- Imported legacy `agent.md` (site repo) → `projects/albery/server-context.md` as the full
  operational reference (UTF-8 verified clean, scanned for secrets — none). Curated docs link to it.
- Hardened `scripts/validate.py`: skip README, expand secret-placeholder allowlist (getpass/env/...).
